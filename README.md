This was a halloween themed show curated by Crow Jones.
Each of the performers was given a particular halloween related word as "guidance" for their performance.

The theme for my set was Fattening.

The performance was done using:

Macbook Pro running:
* SpoonFight  https://github.com/zarquin/SpoonFight

* SpoonLaunch 

* Novation Launchpad Pro

* And the media and SpoonFight patch files in this repository
